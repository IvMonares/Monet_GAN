    "Computer vision has advanced tremendously in recent years and GANs are now capable of mimicking objects in a very convincing way. But creating museum-worthy masterpieces is thought of to be, well, more art than science. So can (data) science, in the form of GANs, trick classifiers into believing you’ve created a true Monet? That’s the challenge you’ll take on!\n",
    "\n",
    "A GAN consists of at least two neural networks: a generator model and a discriminator model. The generator is a neural network that creates the images, while the discriminator determines whether an image is real or not. The two models will work against each other, with the generator trying to trick the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately classify the real vs. generated images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project competition, the goal is to generate 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images, obtaining a Memorization-informed Fréchet Inception Distance (MiFID) smaller than 1000."
